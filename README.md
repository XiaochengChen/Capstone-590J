# Capstone-590J
Capstone project for CS 590J UMass Amherst, Spring 2020.
This project creates an attack to gain access to Windows 7 systems through uploading a keylogger program. This program encodes the  input of the victim machine in photos and uploads them to Imgur, a social media platform. From there, hackers can download and decode the photos to steal private data.
